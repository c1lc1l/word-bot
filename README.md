## Installation

Follow these detailed steps to get the bot up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository  
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal and run:  
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname.git`  
Replace `yourusername` and `yourrepositoryname` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

### 2. Navigate to the project directory  
Change to the directory where the repository was cloned. Run the following command:  
`cd discord-bot`  
This will take you to the folder containing all the project files.

### 3. Install Python and dependencies  
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. If you donâ€™t, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can install the required dependencies using `pip`. Run the following command to install the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
This will automatically install all necessary libraries, such as `discord.py` and `python-dotenv`, that are required to run the bot.

### 4. Verify installation  
To verify that Python and `pip` are correctly installed, you can run the following commands:  
`python --version`  
`pip --version`  
You should see the installed versions of Python and pip in your terminal.

## Setup

### 1. Create a `.env` file  
In the root directory of your project, create a `.env` file and add the following content:  
`DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here`  
Replace `your_token_here` with your actual Discord bot token. You can obtain this token by creating a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Once everything is set up, run the bot with this command:  
`python discord-bot.py`
