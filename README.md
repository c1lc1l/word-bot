## Introduction

This is a simple Discord bot that responds to user commands. It was created using `discord.py` and can be deployed on an EC2 instance. This bot is designed for beginners to learn about deploying a bot on AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Git** installed on your local machine or EC2 instance.
- **Python 3** installed on your EC2 instance.
- A **Discord account** and a bot created in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- **AWS account** with access to EC2.

## Installation

To set up this project on your local machine or EC2 instance:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/word-bot.git
    cd word-bot
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your bot's token:
    ```plaintext
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
    ```

## Setting Up the Bot on EC2

### Launch an EC2 Instance

1. **Sign in to AWS** and go to the **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. Click **Launch Instance** and select **Amazon Linux 2023 AMI**.
3. Choose an instance type (e.g., **t2.micro** for the free tier).
4. Configure your instance, including creating a security group with **SSH** access.
5. Download the `.pem` key file to SSH into the instance later.

### Connect to the EC2 Instance

1. Open **Git Bash** or **Terminal** on your local machine.
2. Navigate to the folder where your `.pem` key is located.
3. Change permissions for the `.pem` file:
    ```bash
    chmod 400 your-key-name.pem
    ```
4. SSH into your EC2 instance:
    ```bash
    ssh -i your-key-name.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
    ```

### Install Dependencies

1. Update the package manager and install Python 3 and pip:
    ```bash
    sudo yum update -y
    sudo yum install python3 -y
    sudo yum install python3-pip -y
    ```

2. Install necessary Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip3 install discord.py python-dotenv
    ```

### Clone the Repository

1. Install Git:
    ```bash
    sudo yum install git -y
    ```

2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/word-bot.git
    cd word-bot
    ```

### Set Up Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```bash
    echo "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-discord-token" > .env
    ```

### Run the Bot

1. Run the bot on your EC2 instance:
    ```bash
    python3 discord-bot.py
    ```

### Keep the Bot Running in the Background

To keep the bot running after you close the terminal, use `screen`:

1. Install `screen`:
    ```bash
    sudo yum install screen -y
    ```

2. Start a new screen session:
    ```bash
    screen -S discord-bot
    ```

3. Run the bot inside the screen:
    ```bash
    python3 discord-bot.py
    ```

4. Detach from the screen session by pressing `Ctrl + A`, then `D`.
5. Reattach to the session later:
    ```bash
    screen -r discord-bot
    ```

## Usage

Once the bot is running, it will listen for messages in your Discord server. You can interact with the bot based on the commands youâ€™ve set up in the code.
